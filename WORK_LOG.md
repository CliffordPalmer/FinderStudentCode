| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 25  | 2:30-3:00pm |                                 In class work — came up with a possible solution, talked through all the stpes of implementing it and debated alternatives. Working theory right now is to have a relatively small hashMap, and deal with collisions by having an array list at each entry. Then, when I check and entry, I'm going to iterate through the (probably short) ArrayList to find the correct value |
| Oct 30  | 1:15-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                  More in class work—started implementing the idea from last class. I've decided to use objects to hold each entry. This way, I can store the key and the value in order to search through each arraylist later. |
| Oct 31  | 6:30-7:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Continued working. Created a hash function in order to make abstract hashing away from the main functions, debugged that for a while but got it working. |
| Oct 31  | 11:00-11:30 |                                                         With the hash function working, I moved on to the buildTable function. To begin with, I have to initialize every arraylist in the hashMap, otherwise I run into nullPointers. Then I loop through the values to add to the table and add them to their appropriate hash values. I also finished query—it's pretty simple with just an enhanced for loop |
| Oct 31  | 11:30-12:00 | Unfortunately my first try didn't work. It took a while, but I eventually figured out that I was subtracting 1 from key and val, assuming that the first collumn of the csv file was collumn one, not zero. It took embarassingly long to figure it out...but with that fixed, it works! And pretty fast too! I'm going to try a few different p values now to try and see if there's a slightly faster option. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
