| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 25  | 2:30-3:00pm |                                                                                                      In class work — came up with a possible solution, talked through all the stpes of implementing it and debated alternatives. Working theory right now is to have a relatively small hashMap, and deal with collisions by having an array list at each entry. Then, when I check and entry, I'm going to iterate through the (probably short) ArrayList to find the correct value |
| Oct 30  | 1:15-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       More in class work—started implementing the idea from last class. I've decided to use objects to hold each entry. This way, I can store the key and the value in order to search through each arraylist later. |
| Oct 31  | 6:30-7:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Continued working. Created a hash function in order to make abstract hashing away from the main functions, debugged that for a while but got it working. |
| Oct 31  | 11:00-11:30 |                                                                                                                              With the hash function working, I moved on to the buildTable function. To begin with, I have to initialize every arraylist in the hashMap, otherwise I run into nullPointers. Then I loop through the values to add to the table and add them to their appropriate hash values. I also finished query—it's pretty simple with just an enhanced for loop |
| Oct 31  | 11:30-12:00 |                                                                      Unfortunately my first try didn't work. It took a while, but I eventually figured out that I was subtracting 1 from key and val, assuming that the first collumn of the csv file was collumn one, not zero. It took embarassingly long to figure it out...but with that fixed, it works! And pretty fast too! I'm going to try a few different p values now to try and see if there's a slightly faster option. |
| Nov 5   |  9:25:9:55  | After learning about linear probing, I spent some time tring to implement a solution. I began just by building a function which could take in a table size and create a hash map on filled to a certain load factor. Then I realized that this function could actually be recursive, and call itself to deal with resizing! My initial try of course didn't work out, and I'm only passing 2/4 of the tests. I'm getting an index out of bounds error that is really confusing me... |
| Nov 7   | 10:00-10:30 |                                                                                                                                                                                   I figured out the index out of bounds error. It turns out I missed one place where I was searching for an empty space in the map, and forgot to wrap around to zero if I got to the end of the map. With that, I pass the tests, BUT one of my solutions takes 37 seconds, and I have no clue why. |
| Nov 7   | 10:30-11:00 |                                                                                                                                                         That was a frustrating bug. It turns out I actually just goofed early on, and set the parameters of my second for loop completely incorrectly. However, it somehow was still managing to work, just REALLY slowly. I changed the bounds for i, and got it working! Now I'm looking for any ways to speed up my working code. |
| Nov 7   | 11:00-11:20 |                                            Found a few small places where I could remove if statements and repeated function calls, experimentally tried a lot of starting sizes for my map. Found that the speed continues going down as the size goes up, but with diminishing returns. Finally settled on 16001 for my starting size, as this is before the diminishing returns really kick in, so I save space while still being fast. Polished my comments and ready to submit! |
